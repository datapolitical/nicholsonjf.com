Slug: Good Enough is good enough!

Last month I signed up as a volunteer videographer for one of my favorite local software communities, [BayPiggies][1] (Bay Area Python Interest Group). As a relatively new programmer, I've been looking for ways to get involved with an open-source project. Shooting some video once a month seemed like something I could handle.

The typical format of a BayPiggies meeting is: announcements, introduce speaker, listen to speaker, Q&A. The first meeting I recorded on Thursday October 24th was no different. The speaker was [Alex Martelli][2], who is an "Uber Technical Lead" at Google and [epic contributor on Stack Overflow][3]. He gave a really interesting talk about our obsession with perfection as a society and how that doesn't really work well with software development in general.

You can watch the entire talk on youtube, [here][4]. A quote from the BayPiggies teaser for Alex's talk describes what I believe to be the key takeaway: "keep the software simple, just "good enough", launch it early, and iteratively improve, enhance, and re-factor it. This is how software success is achieved!
