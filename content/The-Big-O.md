On November 21st I filmed a [BayPiggies][1] talk about [Big-O Notation][5] given by Jeremy Holman, a software engineer at Shuterfly. The entire talk can be viewed in the embedded YouTube video below. While you're at it, subscribe to our channel too!

For a junior developer (like me), it was difficult to make the connection between theory and application. Here's what algorithm analysis means to me: given two different solutions (with identical outputs) to a single problem, whichever one consumes the least resources (money, time, memory, storage, processes) is the one I will choose.

Jeremy was a good speaker with a lot of energy and clearly knows his stuff. In fact, he knows his stuff so well that his explanation of Big-O Notation and how to use it was too high-level for me. So I took to Google in hope of finding some kind of layman's walk-through. Wikipedia does a great job at providing details about instances of concepts we already understand. For example, if you understand what the President of the United States is, Wikipedia is hard to top when it comes to summarizing the life of [Andrew Jackson][6]. But if you don't know what a country is or how the U.S. Government works, the article on Jackson will be of little value to you.

Jeremy's talk and the Wikipedia article on Big-O are great resources to those with an advanced understanding of computer science and math, but they weren't doing it for me. What I needed was something targeted at people with only a modest understanding of computer science, like say,  an article written for high school informatics competitors in Greece. Turns out [Dionysis Zindros][7], a software engineer at Twitter wrote just that. [A Gentle Introduction to Algorithm Complexity Analysis][8] is extremely well written, and is great at delivering a practical understanding of Big-O and how/when to use it.

If you have any comments or questions related to your experience learning or using Big-O, please leave them below!
