On Thursday, January 23rd at 7:30pm the creator and BDFL of Python Guido van Rossum will give a talk at LinkedIn, Mountain View about Tulip (asynchronous I/O for Python 3.3+).

I'll be there, running a Google Hangout on Air which I have embedded below. My goal is for people to be able to visit this page during the talk and watch the broadcast, as well as view it afterwords like a normal embedded YouTube video. Here goes nothing.
