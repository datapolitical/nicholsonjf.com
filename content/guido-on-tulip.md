On Thursday, January 23rd at 7:30pm the creator and BDFL of Python [Guido van Rossum][2] will give a talk at LinkedIn, Mountain View about [Tulip (asynchronous I/O for Python 3)][1].

I'll be there, running a [Google Hangout on Air][3] which I have embedded above. My goal is for people to be able to visit this page during the talk and watch the broadcast live, as well as view it after the fact like a normal embedded YouTube video.

If for any reason the video above is not working, try [LinkedIn's live broadcast][4]. Also, a recording of the talk will be posted a day or two later on the [BayPiggies Youtube channel][5].
