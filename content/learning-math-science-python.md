I attended and filmed the speaker at the December [BayPiggies][1] meeting at LinkedIn. The speaker was [Peter Farrell][2], a mathmatics teacher at a company called [learningtech.org][3].

All in all it was a very interesting talk, showcasing a cool use-case of Python in an educational setting. For another really interesting watch, check out [Peter's YouTube video about modeling eliptical orbits with visual python][4]
