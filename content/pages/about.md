Title: About

I'm James Nicholson, a programmer at [E*Trade][1] and software developer in training. I live in the Bay Area in California, about an hour south of San Francisco.

What do I mean by programmer? At work I use mostly Python and sometimes Perl to standardize data, so it can be stored in sql-server and reviewed by auditors. Thus, I'm not exactly developing software, but writing scripts and functions that can be reused to automate ongoing business processes.

What do I mean by software developer in training? I've only been programming professionally since spring of 2013 and still have a lot to learn. My goal is for my next job to be in some type of software development role, rather than informally using my programming skills in a non-development role.

My language of choice is Python, and I'm trying to focus on becoming as proficient as possible with it before learning another language.

When I'm not learning or working, I'm usually going on adventures with my dog [Zerlina][2].
